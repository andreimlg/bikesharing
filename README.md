## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to know if the same bike Sharing Business of NYC can be replicated in Des Moines. There's a lot of information to be analyzed but with Tableau we'll cover every aspect of it in order to present our conclusions to potential investors.

## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

Checkout times for users: The distribution that follows is aligned to the left with an average close to less than 15 min.

We can imply a similar behavior despite the gender.

Peak hours are shown specifically during the morning and the afternoons (weekdays)  for the weekend the tendency is less clear.

Here's the breakdown by gender:

And what happens if we break down to User type? Clearly our market goes mainly to the subscriber type of user.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

It is important to contrast all this information with the demographics of Des Moins in order to tropicalize the concept. NY City has its own particularities as well as challenges.

Some considerations to keep in mind, locations need to be analyzed so we get the most out of the bikes utilization without hurting them too much. The main expenses in this business are maintenance and bike utilization. We need to keep in mind how much are we going to charge for this service since the cost of living in NYC is far more expensive than the one in Des moines. 

Tableau is a great tool to dive into conclusions or to know what the next steps are very quickly, also it lets you play with the information and get to insights that you probably didn't think of. Great business model! maybe it is worthy to analyze the whole year and contrast the information with how much does it cost the maintenance of the bikes to watch for outliers and other tendencies. Other insight we might want to have is what happens during the winter.
